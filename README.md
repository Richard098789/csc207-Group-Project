## Clean Architecture Implementation

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability. Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns by dividing the project into distinct layers, each with its own responsibility.

### Layers of the Project

1. **Entities**
    - Represent the core business logic and data structures.
    - Independent of frameworks and libraries, ensuring reusability and testability.
    - Example: The `User` and `Artist` classes encapsulate core application logic.

2. **Use Cases**
    - Contain the application's business rules.
    - Orchestrate the flow of data between the entities and the interface adapters.
    - Example: Use cases like `LoginInteractor`, `SignupInteractor`, and `ArtistSearchInteractor` handle business logic for their respective features.

3. **Interface Adapters**
    - Adapt the data to and from the use case and the external systems.
    - Include controllers, presenters, and view models.
    - Example: `ArtistSearchController` adapts user input to the search use case, and `ArtistSearchPresenter` prepares the data for display.

4. **Frameworks and Drivers**
    - External systems like databases, APIs, and user interfaces.
    - Example: Firebase integration for storing comments and ratings, and the `MusicBrainzAPI` for fetching artist and event data.

### Key Principles Followed

- **Dependency Inversion:** Higher-level modules (use cases) do not depend on lower-level modules (frameworks); instead, they depend on abstractions like interfaces.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a specific purpose, ensuring minimal coupling and high cohesion.
- **Testability:** The architecture allows for mocking dependencies, making it easier to write and maintain unit tests.

By adhering to Clean Architecture principles, this project is designed to handle future enhancements and modifications with minimal disruption.
